.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm choparp
is a easy-to-use proxy ARP daemon.
It watches ARP request packets visible on the interface specified by argument
.Ar if_name ,
and sends proxy ARP reply to the sender if the ARP request queries the
MAC address
.Pq ethernet hardware address
for the network specified by
.Ar net_addr Ns / Ns Ar net_mask .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p Ar file
Save process id to the given file.
.It Fl v
Send diagnostic messages to stdout. Repeat to increase verbosity.
.It Ar if_name
Network interface on which to listen and respond to ARP requests.
.It Ar mac_addr
The MAC address to be published for the specified hosts, in one of three formats.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
Static value specified as 6 colon-separated byte values in hexadecimal.
.It Ar vhid: Ns Oo <nnn>|0x<xx> Oc
Virtual router (VRRP/CARP) address with the final octet (VRID)
given by decimal value <nnn> or hexadecimal value <xx> .
.It Ar auto
Usually,
.Ar mac_addr
is the address of
.Ar if_name .
Specify the keyword
.Sy auto
to use the address of
.Ar if_name
detected from the system configuration.
.El
.
.It Ar net_addr
IPv4 address in either dotted quad notation
.Pq for example Ar 192.0.2.2
or, BSD-style, as a 32 bit hexadecimal value starting with
.Dq 0x
.Pq for example Ar 0x858a0186 .
.It Ar net_mask
Alone,
.Ar net_addr
specifies a single host; to specify an IP range, include a
.Ar net_mask
in the same way one would specify a subnet.
Full 32-bit values may be in either dotted-decimal and BSD-style hexadecimal format.
Prefix lengths may be specified in CIDR notation.
The following address specifications are equivalent:
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
.Ar 192.0.2.0/255.255.254.0
.It
.Ar 0xc0000200/0xfffffe00
.It
.Ar 192.0.2.0/0xfffffe00
.It
.Ar 192.0.2.0/23
.El
.Pp
Address matches may be either affirmative or negative, with affirmative as the default.
To exclude an address or range, specify a negative match with a prefix
.Dq -
(dash) prefix.
Multiple matches may be specified, with at least one being affirmative.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
If you have network interface
.Dq ne0
with MAC address
.Dq 00:00:5e:00:53:01
, and would like to send proxy ARP reply for 192.168.0.64/26,
the argument would be as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
choparp ne0 00:00:5e:00:53:01 192.168.0.64/26
.Ed
.Pp
Were
.Dq ne0
assigned the IPv4 address 192.168.0.65/26,
you could additionally exclude the the host address and all-ones and all-zeroes
broadcast addresses as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
choparp ne0 00:00:5e:00:53:01 192.168.0.64/26 -192.168.0.64/31 -192.168.0.127
.Ed
.Sh BUGS
Supports Ethernet interfaces only.
Handles single interface at a time.
.Pq you can start multiple Nm choparp No for multiple interfaces, though .
