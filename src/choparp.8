.Sh NAME
.Nm choparp
.Nd cheap and omitted proxy ARP
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chpoarp
.Ar if_name mac_addr
.Oo Fl Oc Ns Ar net_addr Ns
.Op / Ns Ar net_mask
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm choparp 
is a easy-to-use proxy ARP daemon.
It watches ARP request packets visible on the interface specified by argument
.Ar if_name ,
and sends proxy ARP reply to the sender if the ARP request queries the
MAC address
.Pq ethernet hardware address
for the network specified by
.Ar net_addr Ns / Ar net_mask .
.Pp
.Ar mac_addr
is the MAC address to be published for the specified hosts.
It is normally the address of
.Ar if_name .
The format of
.Ar mac_addr
must be 6 colon-separated bytes of hexadecimal value, such as
.Ad 00:00:01:01:14:46 .
The keyword
.Ad auto
can also be used to use the address of
.Ar if_name
from the system configuration.
.Pp
A
.Xr carp 4
virtual router address can be specified as
.Ad vhid:<hex>
.
.Pp
.Ar net_addr
must be in dotted quad notation
.Pq for example Ad 133.138.1.134
or be a 32 bit hexadecimal value starting with
.Dq 0x
.Pq for example Ad 0x858a0186 .
.Ar net_mask
can likewise be speficied as a dotted quad or hexadecimal value,
or alternatively as a mask length. The following address specifications
are therefore equivalent:
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
.Ad 192.168.98.0/255.255.254.0
.It
.Ad 192.168.98.0/0xfffffe00
.It
.Ad 192.168.98.0/23
.El
.Pp
Multiple addresses can be specified.
Addresses can be
.Em excluded
by preceding them with
.Fl
.Sh EXAMPLES
If you have network interface
.Dq ne0
with MAC address
.Dq 00:00:01:01:14:16 ,
and would like to send proxy ARP reply for 192.168.0.64/26,
the argument would be as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
choparp ne0 00:00:01:01:14:46 192.168.0.64/255.255.255.192
.Ed
.Sh BUGS
Supports Ethernet interfaces only.
Handles single interface at a time.
.Pq you can start multiple Nm choparp No for multiple interfaces, though .
